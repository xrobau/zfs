** THIS IS A STORAGE SERVER **

When this machine is rebooted it will ALWAYS USE KEXEC.

If you have changed the kernel params, they will not take effect
as the default setting is --reuse-cmdline. Edit the kexec-load.service
file in /etc/systemd/system with the correct params, and run
systemctl daemon-reload. Or just do a full reboot.

To force a full system reboot use 'systemctl --force reboot'

IPMI Address of this machine is {{ ipmi.stdout | default("Unknown") }}
